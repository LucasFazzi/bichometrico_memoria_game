I used the source code made in GDSCRIPT by changing the order of some small functions, as well as adding more levels and special effects, besides including the track and other degrees of difficulty (easy, medium and hard).
I also made small changes based on Godot's own console guidelines for performance improvement in 3.1; still has some warnings in the code, but nothing serious or that changes performance.
