# bichometrico_memoria_game
 Godot project using GDScript made for the Bichometrico Memory Game


I used the source code from: 

https://github.com/Tzoop/MemoryGame; 

The soundtrack is from: 

https://devdevious.itch.io
(https://www.patreon.com/sharkybutt)

The sound effects are 

1) https://freesound.org/people/NenadSimic/ 
2) https://freesound.org/people/suntemple/ 
3) https://freesound.org/people/mickleness/ 
4) https : //opengameart.org/users/haeldb

The source code has undergone some extra implementations, to be able to create the different levels and 
some effects of transition and animation of victory, besides to remove some texts just for aesthetic purpose.
I cleaned some variables and re-organized small code lines that I found to be better suited for my case, 
but the source code base follows the same.


Feel free to use the game for your intended purpose (commercial, educational), 
including sprites created specifically for the specific case.


PS: 
I will organize the file divided correctly here in github, 
but for now, for lack of time, I just sent in .rar
